<h1> Redesign </h1>
<p> I redesigned my main wireframe for the homepage. This is because my old wireframe was not capable of being consistent. I realized consistency was very important in attracting users and feel a sense of <strong> unity </strong> </p>
<h4> New Wireframe <h4>

<h4> Subpages <h4>
<img src="Subpage 1.png" />
<img src="Subpage 2.png" />
<img src="Subpage 3.png" />
<img src="Subpage 4.png" />

<h3> Consistency </h3>
<p> To maintain consistency the wireframes show resemble that the blue color can be either modified or changed. The red color is an editable region however the size or poiitioning is strictly limited.

<h3> Quick Review </h3>
<p> The purpose of this project is so Helen's granddad(client) can expand his photography business by attracting today's new high technology generation. </p>
<p> The purpose of this project is for the audience to know the location, services, photographers, history, etc etc. </p>

<h3> Flowchart </h3>

<p> The flowchart will match the website's categories. Moreover we even plan to have hovering categories to resemble the indepth information shown in the flowchart above. </p>
<p> I feel the flowchart is quite indepth and it resembles and completes all the information needed. </p>

<h2> Look and Feel </h2>
<p> I want my website to look organized. I want the user who wants a photograph taken to feel that the website is organized and they should easily find what they are looking for. <p>
<p> Overall the intended message the website is giving is that the photograhpher is a very well respected photograhper, very experienced, and highy skilled.
<p> The theme is quite simple, because we want users to quickly find what they are looking for. <bold> simplicity </bold> is what we sticking with. We also decided that <bold> consistency <bold> is also what I think is quite important. We have regions that can be edited and shaped around, and other special regions that do not need to be edited. This allows the users to feel they belong to the same website they visited the first time. They dont get struck with a sense of being lost. Most importantly it is user-friendly </p>

<h3> Consistency </h3>

<p> The banners for each page will be the exact same thing, same <bold>size</bold>, same <bold>color</bold>, same <bold>words</bold>. This will help acheive a sense of <bold>unity</bold> and belongingness. Users will feel they are at the same place for the same purpose and will not get distracted or lose their main purpose for visiting the website. </p>
<p> The font is Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif. Looking at it from elements of design the font is relatively big and very clear. It has a good amount of space between each of the words which makes it easier to read. We predict users to even range upto senior citizens that use technology, so even
