<h3> Consistency </h3>
<p> To maintain consistency the wireframes show resemble that the blue color can be either modified or changed. The red color is an editable region however the size or poiitioning is strictly limited.

<h3> Quick Review </h3>
<p> The purpose of this project is so Helen's granddad(client) can expand his photography business by attracting today's new high technology generation. </p>
<p> The purpose of this project is for the audience to know the location, services, photographers, history, etc etc. </p>
<p> The audience of this project are new generation adults and teenagers who want to have either passport/visa sized photos or formal posing photo (family, friends, wedding) </p>

<h3> Flowchart </h3>

<p> The flowchart will match the website's categories. Moreover we even plan to have hovering categories to resemble the indepth information shown in the flowchart above. </p>
<p> I feel the flowchart is quite indepth and it resembles and completes all the information needed. </p>

<h2> Look and Feel </h2>
<p> I want my website to look organized. I want the user who wants a photograph taken to feel that the website is organized and they should easily find what they are looking for. </p>
<p> Overall the intended message the website is giving is that the photograhpher is a very well respected photograhper, very experienced, and highy skilled. </p>
<p> The theme is quite simple, because we want users to quickly find what they are looking for. <bold> simplicity </bold> is what we sticking with. We also decided that <bold> consistency </bold> is also what I think is quite important. We have regions that can be edited and shaped around, and other special regions that do not need to be edited. This allows the users to feel they belong to the same website they visited the first time. They dont get struck with a sense of being lost. Most importantly it is user-friendly </p>
<p> The buttons will be gray colored because this is a photography firm with that goes way back to the black and white days. Gray is a color that seems a mix of black and white, so maybe these elements of design can resemble the photography firm itself. </p>
<p> The overall website feel will be a mixture of gray, white, and black. Gray buttons with white text. The net area will have a white background, and the text for the rest of the descriptions will be black. Every page they visit will have a four buttons that allow them to visit any subpage at anytime, just for their convenience.

<h3> Consistency </h3>
<p> The banners for each page will be the exact same thing, same <bold>size</bold>, same <bold>color</bold>, same <bold>words</bold>. This will help acheive a sense of <bold>unity</bold> and belongingness. Users will feel they are at the same place for the same purpose and will not get distracted or lose their main purpose for visiting the website. The banners or in other words the buttons, will be in gray color and white text. </p>
<p> The font is Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif. Looking at it from elements of design the font is relatively big and very clear. It has a good amount of space between each of the words which makes it easier to read. We predict users to even range upto senior citizens that use technology, so I believe such fonts will not make them squint their eyes or work hard to understand the font. </p>
<p> The title or heading colors would most probably be black. I feel that black is a much more bold and effective color and stating something. Title and headers are major statements, they state what this page is about and inform them on the reason they are on this page. It allows the user to confirm if he is on the right page and that will be easily reconginzed by looking at the black title/heading. </p>
<p> The font for the descriptions on the subpages will also be Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif. This is because we want to maintain consistency for the whole website.  If font's change in relatively close regions then users can feel out of place. They could possible lose their purpose and interest. Moreover, users could suddenly feel they do not belong to this page, this is due to having a first schema set for how the website is. If they like the first outlook of the website then the schema is set, changing things could disturb what they expect. </p>
<p> The description colors will usually be black. ALl the colors for description and details will be black. I feel that black is a color meant for reading. Almost everything you read, it is in black- it is almost a default. </p>

<h3> First template/wireframe </h3>
<a <img src="subpage images/first one" width="356" height="364" />
<h4> Evaluation </h4>
<p> The logo and the name is too big. The users know that once they arrive at the website that they are in this photography firm. No need to show off the logo and the name too much </p>
<p> The editable region is just one big box. Adding information can be a problem. Where to add images? Where to add specific details and contacts? How to generally organize information </p>
<p> The page seems to much of an A4 page. The home page is more horizontal styled and much shorter. It would look weird if the subpages were going from top to down. </p>
