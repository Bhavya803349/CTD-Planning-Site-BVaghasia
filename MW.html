<h3> Message, audience, purpose, and goals </h3>
<h4> Goals</h4>
<p> The purpose of this project is so Helen's granddad(client) can expand his photography business by attracting today's new high technology generation. </p>
<p> The purpose of this project is for the audience to know the location, services, photographers, history, etc etc.</p>
<h4>Audience </h4>
<p> The audience of this project are new generation adults and teenagers who want to have either passport/visa sized photos or formal posing photo (family, friends, wedding) </p>
<p> The message these subpages and homepage will be given directly and indirectly. Directly it will be through text and images, however indirectly it can be sublimated through the choice of colour, the size, and the font. </p>
<p> These messages have implications to show the photograpy has old history and that it has worked with many famous people such as Li Ka Shing.
<p> Most important, it has to be professional. Professional how? What is the schema of "professional" looks? Research from a blog of website designers at Outbrain gave me a good insight. </p>
<h5> Professional Looks </h5>
<ul>
  <li> Pay attention to fonts </li>
  <li> "KISS"- Keep it simple stupid. </li>
  <li> Make it easy for people to learn about you </li>
</ul>
<h5> What did I learn? </h5>
<p> Avoid a cluttered site, anything that is hard to look at, and a confusion to navigate. The website should be kept clean and clutter free, well organized, and great at directing users exactly where they want to go. </p>
<h5> Example of a cluttered website </h5>

<p> Picking a font that matches or represents your company will give that professional glow- modern and distinctive. Larger fonts should be used for headings and subheadings, titles, and important need-to-know information. Choose fonts that are easy to see, easy on the eyes , and are easy to read. </p>
<p> To make your website look much more professional it is important have a section where people can find links for discovering all that they need to know about your business. Usually located at the bottom of the website. </p>

<h3> Flowchart </h3>
<div style="width: 480px; height: 360px; margin: 10px; position: relative;"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder="0" style="width:480px; height:360px" src="https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/embeddedchart/de29a47d-2b47-4454-a7e0-1358196eba14" id=".D_-MzgUnCd3"></iframe><a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/examples/mind_mapping_software" style="margin: 0; padding: 0; border: none; display: inline-block; position: absolute; bottom: 5px; left: 5px;"><img alt="mind mapping software"title="Lucidchart online diagrams"style="width: 100px; height: 30px; margin: 0; padding: 0; border-image: none; border: none; display: block"src="https://www.lucidchart.com/img/diagrams-lucidchart.png"/></a></div>
<p> The flowchart will match the website's categories. Moreover we even plan to have hovering categories to resemble the indepth information shown in the flowchart above. </p>
<p> I feel the flowchart is quite indepth and it resembles and completes all the information needed. </p>

<h2> Look and Feel </h2>
<p> I want my website to look organized. I want the user who wants a photograph taken to feel that the website is organized and they should easily find what they are looking for. </p>
<p> Overall the intended message the website is giving is that the photograhpher is a very well respected photograhper, very experienced, and highy skilled. </p>
<p> The theme is quite simple, because we want users to quickly find what they are looking for. <bold> simplicity </bold> is what we sticking with. We also decided that <bold> consistency </bold> is also what I think is quite important. We have regions that can be edited and shaped around, and other special regions that do not need to be edited. This allows the users to feel they belong to the same website they visited the first time. They dont get struck with a sense of being lost. Most importantly it is user-friendly </p>
<p> The buttons will be gray colored because this is a photography firm with that goes way back to the black and white days. Gray is a color that seems a mix of black and white, so maybe these elements of design can resemble the photography firm itself. </p>
<p> The overall website feel will be a mixture of gray, white, and black. Gray buttons with white text. The net area will have a white background, and the text for the rest of the descriptions will be black. Every page they visit will have a four buttons that allow them to visit any subpage at anytime, just for their convenience. </p>

<h3> Consistency </h3>
<p> The banners for each page will be the exact same thing, same <bold>size</bold>, same <bold>color</bold>, same <bold>words</bold>. This will help acheive a sense of <bold>unity</bold> and belongingness. Users will feel they are at the same place for the same purpose and will not get distracted or lose their main purpose for visiting the website. The banners or in other words the buttons, will be in gray color and white text. </p>
<p> The font is Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif. Looking at it from elements of design the font is relatively big and very clear. It has a good amount of space between each of the words which makes it easier to read. We predict users to even range upto senior citizens that use technology, so I believe such fonts will not make them squint their eyes or work hard to understand the font. </p>
<p> The title or heading colors would most probably be black. I feel that black is a much more bold and effective color and stating something. Title and headers are major statements, they state what this page is about and inform them on the reason they are on this page. It allows the user to confirm if he is on the right page and that will be easily reconginzed by looking at the black title/heading. </p>
<p> The font for the descriptions on the subpages will also be Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif. This is because we want to maintain consistency for the whole website.  If font's change in relatively close regions then users can feel out of place. They could possible lose their purpose and interest. Moreover, users could suddenly feel they do not belong to this page, this is due to having a first schema set for how the website is. If they like the first outlook of the website then the schema is set, changing things could disturb what they expect. </p>
<p> The description colors will usually be black. All the colors for description and details will be black. I feel that black is a color meant for reading. Almost everything you read, it is in black- it is almost a default. </p>

<h3> First wireframe </h3>
<img src="subpage images/first one.png" width: 356px height: 364px />
<h4> Evaluation </h4>
<p> The logo and the name is too big. The users know that once they arrive at the website that they are in this photography firm. No need to show off the logo and the name too much </p>
<p> The editable region is just one big box. Adding information can be a problem. Where to add images? Where to add specific details and contacts? How to generally organize information </p>
<p> The page seems to much of an A4 page. The home page is more vertical styled and much shorter. It would look weird if the subpages were going from top to down. </p>

<h3> A new and better subpage templage has been made from the following problems mentioned above. Please look at the below from clicking the subpage template link. </h3>
<h4> This is the templage made for all our subpages </h4>
<img src="subpage images/subpage template.png" width="356" height="364" />
<h3> Evaluation for new wireframe </h3>
<p> This new wireframe is not so logo and named base, because users already know who's website they are visiting. I feel that this allows are more professional look, than a massive logo sticking out because in a sense it seems bombastic. </p>
<p> The page is not shaped to be an A4 page, it is more of a user friendly horizontal page, where users can just look from left to right and look at everything with the need to scroll. I feel that this helps our objective to allow users to visit and find what they want. It saves <strong> time. </strong> </p>
<p> This wireframe allows more organization. There are more editable regions, that allow you to organize information into introductory, priority, and information. Div 1 is introductory informaton, Div 2 is priority information, Div 9 is for images and extra information. </p>
<p> The reason why the editable regions have been located the way they are is because according to an eye tracking study, users start their attention from the upper left corner and than moves on from there.</br> Moreover, a study from yahoo has concluded results that the top left corner get the attention first, so the starting point to anything valuable should be there. </p>
