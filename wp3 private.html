  <h4> Team Decision </h6>
    <p> From all the proposals on eaglenet, we have decided to work on Helen's grandfather's photography company. </p>
    <h4> Goals</h4>
    <p> The purpose of this project is so Helen's granddad(client) can expand his photography business by attracting today's new high technology generation. </p>
    <p> The purpose of this project is for the audience to know the location, services, photographers, history, etc etc.</p>
    <h4>Audience </h4>
    <p> The audience of this project are new generation adults and teenagers who want to have either passport/visa sized photos or formal posing photo (family, friends, wedding) </p>
    <h4> Team Objectives </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Make a website for Helen's grand dad </li>
      <li> Use trello to plan and work on problems </li>
      <li> Use lucidchart to make a flowchart to breakdown website essentials </li>
      <li> Use GitHub group planning website to record progressment </li>
    </ul>

    <h4> Who is our client? </h4>
    <p> Our client is Helen's Grandad </p>
    <p> I think it is important to meet him ASAP because we need to know what his <strong>problems</strong> are and figure out his <strong>goals</strong> for expanding his business and how a website can help him acheive this goal.. </p>
    <p> What we want to solve for Helen's granddad is too ideally help him expand his business. His photography business goes up to many generations and heritage, thus it is only well-known with old peopkle. By making a website on the internet that the recent and young generation are constantly using, we can help him expand his business. A google search relating to his services that could lead to his website could increase his business as a whole because everytime somebody views his website, the brand is getting well-known. </p>
