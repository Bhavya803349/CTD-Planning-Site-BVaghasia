<h1> WP:6 Navigation and Elements </h1>

<h2> Making Buttons </h2>
<p> Making buttons with Mr. Chiu. Using fireworks we were able to make buttons and these buttons include over and down gradients. When not clicked it can be a bit lighter and when clicked it will be darker. This allows us to know which page we are in and which button we have just recently clicked. </p>
<p> Using fireworks its a very five minute simple step. Most of it is just part of a design, however one major step that allows the custom handmade box into a button is really what just does its magic. </p>
<p> Using options such as over and down allow you to add things like hover view and you can see different colours when hovered over. Clicking it will also allow you to view different things. Depends on your preferences and settings. </p>

<h3> Planning the Buttons and Navigation Elements. </h3>
<img src="images/IMG_1454.JPG" width="356" height="364" />
<p> There are 5 links and 5 titles that need to be created </p>
<p> The look and feel has to be consistent with the look and feel of the webpage. The buttons must seem to belong with the rest of the webpage. If they seem out of contrast or size then consistency will not be maintained. Users might get distracted for their purpose and lose interest. </p>
<p> After reading the article on important webpage principles from pickthebrain, I have found that it is important to take every step think like a user and then design because it will make the webpage grow more into what a future expected uesr would want it to be like. Moreover, I learnt that keeping it simple with simplistic elements such as photos would be better than high graphic photos that take time to load. Do not test the patience of the user because he won't feel its professional or matching the standard he expected. Always try to meet the users expectations as much as possible. </p>

<h3> Navigation </h3>
<p> The navigation bar will be just below the logo. This will allow users to straight away get into their purpose for what they visited their site. So it will be relatively around top middle of the webpage. </p>
<p> On the navigation bar the contexts will be buttons that help users navigate through vague purposes they could possible interested. Dont worry, I know vague is not good, however this will allow users to enter where they are interested and view their choice in much more detail. There will be four buttons that resemble four choices. The context are, services, gallery, heritage, and contact us. </p>
<p> The navigation bar will be on every page because this will allow users to quickly run through pages without going back to home. Moreover, they can go to any other page and go to home anytime. I believe this will allow users to save time and find their purpose for visiting their webiste much quicker. This also allows to maintain consistency and keep them feeling belonged without losing interest. </p>
<p> The navigation bar will allow users to know which page they are on. This is because the button they click on through the navigation bar will allow the user to visit their subject on interest will be slighly highlighted or shaded. If not highligted or shaded it will be illusioned to look like it has been pressed. This is a really good illusion because it shows that the user has literally pressed that button and they are currently on that site. </p>
<p> This is the mini wireframe I had created for my navigation bar. </p>

<h3> Textual Navigation </h3>
<p> The way I made a textual link was to make a box and then added text to it. After adding the text, I linked the text with my page </p>
<p> To view this in action, look at the navigation bar above were WP6 is represented. </p>

<h3> Graphical Navigation </h3>
