<h1> WP:6 Navigation and Elements </h1>

<h3> Navigation </h3>
<p> The navigation bar will be just below the logo. This will allow users to straight away get into their purpose for what they visited their site. So it will be relatively around top middle of the webpage. </p>
<p> On the navigation bar the contexts will be buttons that help users navigate through vague purposes they could possible interested. Dont worry, I know vague is not good, however this will allow users to enter where they are interested and view their choice in much more detail. There will be four buttons that resemble four choices. The context are, services, gallery, heritage, and contact us. </p>
<p> The navigation bar will be on every page because this will allow users to quickly run through pages without going back to home. Moreover, they can go to any other page and go to home anytime. I believe this will allow users to save time and find their purpose for visiting their webiste much quicker. This also allows to maintain consistency and keep them feeling belonged without losing interest. </p>
<p> The navigation bar will allow users to know which page they are on. This is because the button they click on through the navigation bar will allow the user to visit their subject on interest will be slighly highlighted or shaded. If not highligted or shaded it will be illusioned to look like it has been pressed. This is a really good illusion because it shows that the user has literally pressed that button and they are currently on that site. </p>
<p> This is the mini wireframe I had created for my navigation bar. </p>
