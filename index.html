<h3> My ideas <h3>
<ul>
  <li> Psychology topic: memory </li>
  <li> Marketing website </li>
  <li> Website for the E-News </li>
  <li> Rhetorical Devices and Strategies (AP Lang and Comp) </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="color:red"> Cutting it down </h3>
<p> After Mr. Chiu's enligtening lecture on the purpose of the website, I have realized that it is better to keep it <strong> simple </strong>. <br> I have to fit my information on 4xA4 sides and make it ideal for people to visit a simple website made by an AIS student. </br> </p>
<p>After thinking ideally and in a simple minded view, I have cut down the Marketing website and the website for E-news. This si because theses websites obviosly cannot fit into 4xA4 sides. </p>
<p> The two ideas from the four, I have chosen to do either psychology or english. </p>
