<p> The strengths of using Fireworks </p>
<ul>
  <li> Easier for image related work. Such as size, format, pixel, blur, etc </li>
  <li> Different layers can be hidden or shown- then locked for being able to edit easily </li>
  <li> Different parts of your work can be saved/published seperately. For example, you can make buttons, but then just save the images for the buttons, boxes, or from a seperate layer. </li>
  <li> Can crop/resize/edit images on the same software in the photo's respective file rather than going back to Fireworks if this process needs to be done when using Dreamweaver </li>
  <li> Better for coordinating the layout of the whole page (spacing/alignment). </li>
</ul>

<p> The strengths of using Dreamweaver </p>
<ul>
  <li> Easier for CSS/styling </li>
  <li> Allows users to drag images directly from the list of files in the folder on the side </li>
  <li> Fireworks doesn't work well for printing your designs. Since the dots.per.inch is relatively lower. (Even though we learnt to change it, we dont really do it), the images come out a little bitmapped. </li>
  <li> Can change CSS altogether as a class/tag/div using RULE: all titles had the same properties by adding the same rule to each AP div </li>
  <li> Semi-automatically writes codes for you </li>
  <li> Editable code on the side - Split screen mode --> makes it easier to effect changes </li>
</ul>
